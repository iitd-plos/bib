of semantic preservation) of a compiler from Cminor (a C-like
imperative language) to PowerPC assembly code, using the Coq proof
assistant both for programming the compiler and for proving its
correctness.  Such a certified compiler is useful in the context of
formal methods applied to the certification of critical software: the
certification of the compiler guarantees that the safety properties
proved on the source code hold for the executable compiled code as well.},

Verification conditions are validated using the automatic theorem prover CVC Lite.",

abstract="We present a method for verifying relational program properties, that is, properties that relate the input and the output of two programs. Our verification method is parametric with respect to the definition of the operational semantics of the programming language in which the two programs are written. That definition of the semantics consists of a set Int of constrained Horn clauses (CHCs) that encode the interpreter of the programming language. Then, given the programs and the relational property we want to verify, we generate, by using Int, a set of constrained Horn clauses whose satisfiability is equivalent to the validity of the property. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art solvers for CHCs have severe limitations in proving the satisfiability, or the unsatisfiability, of such sets of clauses. We propose some transformation techniques that increase the power of CHC solvers when verifying relational properties. We show that these transformations, based on unfold/fold rules, preserve satisfiability. Through an experimental evaluation, we show that in many cases CHC solvers are able to prove the satisfiability (or the unsatisfiability) of sets of clauses obtained by applying the transformations we propose, whereas the same solvers are unable to perform those proofs when given as input the original, untransformed sets of CHCs.",

The difficulty here is that the ring ¿mof integers modulo m = 2w, w > 1, has zero divisors and thus cannot be embedded into a field. Not withstanding that, we present intra- and inter-procedural algorithms for inferring for every program point u, affine relations between program variables valid at u. Our algorithms are not only sound but also complete in that they detect all valid affine relations. Moreover, they run in time linear in the program size and polynomial in the number of program variables and can be implemented by using the same modular integer arithmetic as the target language to be analyzed.",

publisher="Springer International Publishing",

abstract="Program equivalence checking is a fundamental problem in computer science with applications to translation validation and automatic synthesis of compiler optimizations. Contemporary equivalence checkers employ SMT solvers to discharge proof obligations generated by their equivalence checking algorithm. Equivalence checkers also involve algorithms to infer invariants that relate the intermediate states of the two programs being compared for equivalence. We present a new algorithm, called invariant-sketching, that allows the inference of the required invariants through the generation of counter-examples using SMT solvers. We also present an algorithm, called query-decomposition, that allows a more capable use of SMT solvers for application to equivalence checking. Both invariant-sketching and query-decomposition help us prove equivalence across program transformations that could not be handled by previous equivalence checking algorithms.",

A difficult subproblem is the automatic identification of the correlations across the transitions between the two programs' respective locations. We present a counterexample-guided algorithm to identify these correlations in a robust and scalable manner. Our algorithm has both theoretical and empirical advantages over prior work in this problem space.},

@phdthesis{loop_fission, place={United States}, title={Optimizing supercompilers for supercomputers}, abstractNote={This thesis discusses several problems facing compiler design for supercomputers. One problem is that of building a comprehensive yet efficient means of representing the flow of data in a program. A means is proposed of computing a data dependence graph and labelling the arcs with direction vectors that show how the flow of data corresponds to the loop structure of the program. These data dependence direction vectors are used in several high level compiler loop optimizations, namely, loop vectorization, loop fission, loop fusion and loop interchanging. It is shown how to perform these transformations and how to use them to optimize programs for a wide range of supercomputers. The problems of recurrence relations are also discussed. Arithmetic recurrences with IF statements, and recurrences involving both data and control dependence relations in a cycle are studied. The wavefront method of solving recurrences is also treated. Another problem for a compiler is the management of compiler temporary variables; supercomputer compilers must manage temporary arrays, and ways to make this problem more tractable are discussed. Finally WHILE loops are discussed and it is shown how they relate to iterative DO loops, and several methods to execute WHILE loops on a machine are shown. THe general structure of an optimizing compiler for supercomputers, developed from the experience with a test-bed compiler, is given.}, school={Univ. of Illinois,Urbana, IL}, author={Wolfe, M.J.}, year={1982}, month={Jan}}
